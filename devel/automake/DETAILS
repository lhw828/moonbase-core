automake - Generates Makefile.in files
Automake automatically generates make files compliant with the GNU coding
standards. It was inspired by the 4.4 BSD make and include files, but aims to
be portable and to confrom to the GNU standards for Make file variables and
targets. Automake is a Perl script.
The input files are called Makefile.am the output files are called Makefile.in.
They are intended for use with autoconf. Automake requires certain things to be
done in your configure.in.
This package also includes the aclocal program, which generates an aclocal.m4
based on the contents of configure.in.
It is useful as an extensible, maintainable mechanism for augmenting autoconf.
