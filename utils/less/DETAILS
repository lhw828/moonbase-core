'Less' is a paginator file similar to 'more, but that allows backward
as well as forward movement through the file. In addition, it doesn't
have to read the entire input file before starting, so it starts large
files faster than text editors like vi. Less uses termcap (or terminfo
on some terminals) so it can run on a variety of terminals; there is
even limited support for hard copy terminals.
